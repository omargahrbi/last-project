            <h1 class="H1">WHY WE DO THIS?</h1>
            <p class="P">Our mission is to provide a home to all the dogs we take care of. We are a temporal shelter for hundreds of doggies seeking a second opportunity,
            and also a permanent home for others that probably will never find a family.
            We are a non-profit organization, founded by Lya Battle and Alvaro Saumet in 2006 for promoting well-being and respect for animals.</p>

            <h1 class="H1">How we do it?</h1>
            <p class="P">Taking care of a big pack has a lot of challenges. We have a big tribe of people who help us get our dogs neutered, fed, and loved every single day. Each animal we take care of costs us around $36 monthly. At Territorio we imagine a world where all  dogs have a home and true love.</p>

                <p class="P">Each month we consume thousands of kilos of dog food, to keep our pack healthy. Giving a full small plate to each mutt cost us $25 per month.</p>
